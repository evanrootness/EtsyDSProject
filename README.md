## Etsy Data Science Project

Data Science project with the goal of scraping art listings from Etsy to explore trends and draw insights useful to a novice artist wanting to sell their art as a hobby.

Some of my goals:
* Determine which mediums of art are most successful (e.g. watercolor, painting, drawing, etc.)
* Determine what art subjects are most successful (e.g. pets, nature, portraits, etc.)
* Of print type listings, what subjects are most succesful, and how do they compare to originals
* Explore how size affects listings' prices
* See how accurate a machine learning model (likely regression) can guess a listing price based only on the name of the listing and possibly size

Findings so far:
* Of listings under $100, the highest median price subjects were 'portrait', 'pet', and 'house'.
* Of listing under $100, the medium with the highest mean and median was 'paint'.
* Of listings above $100, the best selling subjects were 'portrait' and 'custom'.
